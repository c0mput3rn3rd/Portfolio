                My name is Jason Armitage. I will earn a Bachelor of Business degree in Computer Information Systems 
                from the University of North Texas in May 2022. I have a strong passion for technology, 
                both the hardware and software sides of the industry.

                In 2011, I started programming for the Arduino microcontroller. I branched out to start developing websites for the 
                video game servers I was hosting from home, so my friends could see server status and info without contacting me. 
                By 2012, I was building my own computers. One unique computer was a model of the Team Fortress 2 minigun, 
                which I had featured in various PC gaming magazines

                <br>
                I joined a VEX Robotics team from my hometown and was the lead programmer. Our team earned a spot to compete in the 
                VEX Robotics World Championship of 2015. Soon after leaving the VEX team, I was selected after an arduous process for an 
                internship with the University Of New Hampshire for a government-funded civil engineering project. I worked with graduate 
                students within the Civil Engineering and Mathematics departments and performed full-stack web development for the project's website.

                Throughout my education, I have taken several programming courses and taught myself photography, videography, electrical engineering, 
                and computer networking. I have also taken multiple programming courses for front-end web development, including HTML, CSS, and 
                JavaScript. I also took a programming course focused on Python. At the University of North Texas, I took several courses on C/C++, 
                Java, databases, and an eCommerce web development course.

                In my free time, I enjoy working with hobby electronics. Ultimately, this led to a YouTube channel, GeekSeek, which I work on with my 
                father that encompasses many activities. Aside from this, I enjoy spending time outdoors hiking, fishing, camping, and photographing 
                wildlife such as birds, fish, bears, and other natural wonders.
