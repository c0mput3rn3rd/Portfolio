                My name is Jason Armitage and I graduated from the University of North Texas in May of 2022 with a Bachelor of Business degree in Computer Information Systems. 
                Currently, I work as an ERP Systems Analyst, utilizing my passion for technology to support my clients' operational processes.

                <br>
                With a strong background in technology, I have been programming since 2011, starting with the Arduino microcontroller. 
                I later expanded my skillset to web development and built websites for video game servers, as well as built my own computers, 
                including a unique model of a Team Fortress 2 minigun, which was featured in PC gaming magazines.
                <br>
                <br>
                I have practical experience in both software and hardware, having served as the lead programmer for a VEX Robotics team that 
                competed in the VEX Robotics World Championship in 2015. Additionally, I was selected for an internship at the University of New Hampshire, 
                where I worked with graduate students and performed full-stack web development for a government-funded civil engineering project. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Throughout my education, I have taken several programming courses, including front-end web development, Python, C/C++, Java, and databases, 
                as well as taught myself photography, videography, electrical engineering, and computer networking. In my free time, I enjoy working on a YouTube channel, 
                Science Shack, which focuses on hobby programming projects, hobby electronics, and other STEM related endeavours. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Given my experience and passion for technology, I am confident that I would be a valuable asset to any software development team.
