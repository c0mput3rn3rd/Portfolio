        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <div class="center">
            <p class="about_info">
                My name is Jason Armitage. I am graduating from the University of North Texas in May 2022 with a 
                Bachelors in Business Computer Information Systems. I have a strong passion for technology, both
                the hardware and software sides of the industry.

            <p class="about_info">
                I started programming in the 7th grade (2011), writing simple programs for the Arduino microcontroller. 
                From there I branched out to start developing my own websites for the video game servers I was 
                hosting from home, so my friends could see server status and info without needing to contact me.
                In 8th grade (2012) I started building my own computers, and have built many computers over the years
                for myself, friends, and family.

            <p class="about_info">
                In 10th grade (2014) I joined my high school's VEX Robotics team and was the programmer for the team.
                That year we made it to, and competed, in the VEX Robotics world competition. The summer after that (2015)
                I got an internship at the University Of New Hampshire working on a government funded civil engineering
                research project. I was working with grad students doing full stack web development for the projects website.

            <p class="about_info">
                Throughout my schooling I have taken several different programming courses, as well as self taught outside of
                school. In high school I took multiple front end web development courses, a Python course, as well as a SQL
                database course. In college I took several C/C++ courses, Java courses, database courses, and a ecommerce web
                development course.
